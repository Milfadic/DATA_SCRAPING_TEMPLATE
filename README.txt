The purpose of the following scripts is to illustrate a complex data scraping program that was created to scrap a 
dynamic website. The website provides information based on a query of a backend
database. It uses Javascript to interact with the client and does not use absolute names on the results table. 

The following is provided for illustration purposes only. It does not include the website's name but has several 
annotations that might help the reader develop his/her own scripts. 

The main file is SCRAP.PY. The functions are defined in the FUNCTIONS.py and the files are defined in the
inputfile.py. 

If you require additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.
